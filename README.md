# Electricity Billing

A Java-based billing system that asks for each customer's name, house number, and units of electricity used. 
Based on  unit slabs (e.g. 10 units = Rs. 100, 20 units = Rs. 250, etc.), the program calculates the total bill for each customer. After processing 3â€“5 houses, it prints the bill for each total amount and customer name with the house number and identifies the highest paying customer along with their house number.

| Units    |      Cost      |
|:---------|:--------------:|
| 1 to 10  |    Rs. 100     |
| 10 to 20 |    Rs. 250     |
| above 20 | Rs. 2 per unit |
